# 2MMS50-Reinforcement-Learning-Assignment
This is the repository for running the third assignment.

### Setup
The usual python setup is recommended:

```
git clone 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Linux/Mac
If you have acces to bash, then you can run the `runSimulations.sh` to have all three simulations run in parallel. 
This greatly speeds up the training, as python is single threaded. 

### Training Data
The training data is located in each folder, so you can continue the training if needed.
